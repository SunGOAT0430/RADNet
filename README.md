## Abstract

Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) aims to improve image quality under suboptimal lighting conditions. In this work, we propose RADNet, a novel network leveraging Retinex theory and anisotropic diffusion for precise illumination estimation. RADNet comprises a Residual Dense Feature Extraction Module, a Retinex-based Anisotropic Diffusion Module, and a Selective Focus Attention Mechanism. These components synergistically enhance global and local features while preserving image details and texture. Experimental results demonstrate that RADNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets, achieving PSNR gains of up to 24.55 dB and SSIM scores exceeding 0.91, thereby enhancing image quality and realism.
